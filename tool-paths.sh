# Where the toolchain lives, without naming anybody's home directory.
#
# Every script here had a path baked into it from whichever machine it was last
# edited on -- and not the same machine, so build-hap.sh pointed at one home
# directory and sign-system.sh at another, and neither pair worked at once.
#
# The environment variable still wins, so nothing that already sets KIT_ROOT,
# HDC_DIR or HAPSIGNER changes behaviour. What changed is the fallback: it looks
# for the thing instead of asserting where it is, and says which variable to set
# when it cannot find it, rather than failing later with "no such file".
#
# Every candidate below is relative to $HOME. No absolute home directory belongs
# in a shared repository: it names one person, means nothing to anyone else, and
# the $HOME form already covers that person -- a kit sitting directly in
# someone's home is $HOME/ArkTS_Agent_Kit when that someone runs the script.
#
# One layout detail worth knowing: the kit's executables are not always in the
# same place. An unpacked kit puts them in tools/, a pip install in .venv/bin.
# These look for the binary, not the directory.

# An explicitly set KIT_ROOT is an instruction, not a hint: if the kit is named
# and the binary is not in it, say so rather than quietly using a different kit,
# which would turn a typo into a mysterious build against the wrong toolchain.
